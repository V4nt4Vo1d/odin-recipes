        <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (25 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Cannabutter (above)</li>

    <h1>Instructions:</h1>

    <h3>For the Cannabutter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Decarboxylate the cannabis: Preheat your oven to 240째F (115째C). Break up the cannabis into small pieces and spread it evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until the cannabis is lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Infuse the butter: In a small saucepan, combine the decarboxylated cannabis, butter, and water. Simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture: After simmering, strain the butter through a fine mesh strainer into a container, discarding the solid plant material. Allow the cannabutter to cool and solidify.</li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <h3>For the Brownies:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, melt the cannabutter. Stir in the sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Fold in the chocolate chips or chunks.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake.</li>
        <li>Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares and serving.</li>
