    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <h3>For the Cannabutter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Decarboxylate the cannabis: Preheat your oven to 240째F (115째C). Break up the cannabis into small pieces and spread it evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until the cannabis is lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Infuse the butter: In a small saucepan, combine the decarboxylated cannabis, butter, and water. Simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture: After simmering, strain the butter through a fine mesh strainer into a container, discarding the solid plant material. Allow the cannabutter to cool and solidify.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>For the Cookies:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, melt the cannabutter. Stir in the granulated sugar and molasses until well combined. Let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the butter mixture and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the oats and maple syrup.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>For the Frosting:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add the lemon juice and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Once the cookies are completely cool, spread or pipe the frosting onto each cookie. Optionally, garnish with crushed cookies or a sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. Enjoy your delicious cannabis-infused chocolate chip cookies!</li>
