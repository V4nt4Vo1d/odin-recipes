    <h1>Instructions:</h1>

    <h3>For the Cannabutter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Decarboxylate the cannabis: Preheat your oven to 240째F (115째C). Break up the cannabis into small pieces and spread it evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for 30-40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until the cannabis is lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Infuse the butter: In a small saucepan, combine the decarboxylated cannabis, butter, and water. Simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture: After simmering, strain the butter through a fine mesh strainer into a container, discarding the solid plant material. Allow the cannabutter to cool and solidify.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>For the Cupcakes:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the cannabutter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Alternately add the dry ingredients and milk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>For the Frosting:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat the butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2-3 tablespoons of heavy cream or milk, and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the cupcakes are completely cool, spread or pipe the frosting onto each cupcake. Optionally, garnish with sprinkles or edible glitter.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. Enjoy your delicious cannabis-infused vanilla cupcakes!</p>
